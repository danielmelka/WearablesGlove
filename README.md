# WearablesGlove
Repository for all code created as part of the WashU Robotics Club Wearables project team. https://www.washurobotics.com/
This team created a flexible and wearable glove designed to track orientation and finger position which was then pipelined to a Blender program which displayed a model of the glove.

All files are included for posterities sake.  Final files for the working demo were Glove_Comm.ino in the Arduino folder and GloveFinal.blend in the Blender folder.
They were built on the Arduino IDE using an Arduino LilyPad running on a ATmega328P processor in C and in Blender 3.5 in Python respectively.

Glove hardware used a WT901 IMU (MPU-6050 was used in testing) and Images SI flexible stretch sensors (STRX-06).
